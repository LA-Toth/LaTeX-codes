\chapter{Layout and design}\label{ch:layout}

The design is inspired by various existing books and \LaTeX{} packages.
The chapter titles are inspired by the Manning Publication's format,
similar to the table of contents. The colors, the page headers and
footers, and the side margin notes are inspired by the
\LaTeX{} Companion, 3rd.\ edition.

The overall size (geometry), text size, and various other settings
are hardcoded, to 11pt, A4 paper size.
